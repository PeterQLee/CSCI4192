* MG Series
** time series with free parameters
*** Ended up that the model just kept emulating the input

** time series with fixed parameters
*** still ended up models emulating inputs.
*** Adding additional epochs evens everything out to a single line
*** Will try training with less time steps improve accuracy?
(Check if the weird tile thing is causing the network to break down?)
